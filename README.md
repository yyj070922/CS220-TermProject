## How to Play

### Board Layout

This board represents the starting position of a two-player Dobutsu Shogi.

```
+---+---+---+
| G | L | E |   1   2   3            Blue hand
+---+---+---+
|   | C |   |   4   5   6             []
+---+---+---+
|   | C |   |   7   8   9             []
+---+---+---+
| E | L | G |  10  11  12            Red hand
+---+---+---+
```

The Blue player’s pieces are placed on the top row, and the Red player’s pieces are placed on the bottom row. 
Each player has three main pieces: a Giraffe (G), a Lion (L), and an Elephant (E). 
Both players also have a Chick (C) placed near the center of the board. 
Empty spaces are shown as blank cells, and each side’s captured pieces are displayed in their respective hand areas beside the board.

### Taking a Turn

## Game Flow

1. The following prompt is displayed, and the user can select a game option by entering a number.

   - Enter the source position and destination position.
   - If the positions are invalid, you are asked to try again.

   - If the move is illegal for that piece, you are asked to try again.
8. If you choose `Drop`:

   - Enter the piece from your hand and the target position.
   - If the piece is not in your hand, you are asked to try again.
   - If the target square is already occupied, you are asked to try again.
9. If the action is valid, the board is updated.
10. Captured pieces are added to the current player’s hand.
11. The turn changes to the other player.
12. The game ends when:
    - a player captures the opponent’s Lion, or
    - a player moves their Lion to the opposite end of the board without risk of being captured.

### Piece Movement
